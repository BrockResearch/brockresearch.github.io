# Brock Research
This site is a repository and publication channel for my professional thoughts, opinions, and experiments.

"*Open mind. Open Standard. Open Source.*" captures my professional approach to execution and value creation. It is my sincere hope that others benefit from my work and offer constructive criticism.
